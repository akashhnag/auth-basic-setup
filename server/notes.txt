ans) a)url is the complete string in the url bar. the above example is an url.
b)path is the anything after the the port number or the domain name is a path. in the above example "/auth" is the
path.
c)route defines the path along with the path and the http request intended for it. in above example "/auth" might
make a get request or a post request etc.

project related issues:

1)very important to install nodemon as dev dependency using npm i --save-dev.
2)Importing express.Router, make sure its express.Router() and not just express.Router. It throws a nasty error.
3)body-parser comes inbuilt no need of installing it explicitly.
